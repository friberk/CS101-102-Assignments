# CS101-102 Assignments

**DISCLAIMER:** All the work here has been shared on GitHub to create an archive of materials from the CS101 and CS102 courses. You should not use those codes for your academic studies. Otherwise, you will do nothing but deceive yourself.

This repository consists of my solutions to every single work in Bilkent University CS101 and CS102 courses. As a freshman, I took the courses from David Davenport and Aynur Dayanık, respectively, in the 2020-2021 academic year.

_Note for CS101 Labs:_ Originally, all labs from CS101 complied with CS101/102 style guidelines. But since it has been a long time and my coding style changed, they started to look inconsistent to me, and because I am lazy enough, I edited all the documents with a syntax formatter instead of editing them one by one. Therefore, they probably do not fit into style guidelines right now.

## Structure

All assignments are organized in the following order:

```
course_code/
├── assignment_type/
    ├── assignment1/
    ├── assignment2/
    └── assignment3/
        ├── ...
        ├── ...
        └── README.md
```
The corresponding instructions for almost every assignment can be found in the ``README.md`` file in their own folder.

## Contributing & Help

In case of any issues or adjustments, feel free to open up a pull request or create an issue. If you decided to send a pull request, make sure the tab size is four spaces and follow the CS101/102 style guidelines.

Currently, instructions for CS101 Lab02a,b Lab04e,f,g Lab08a,b,c are missing. If you have one or more of these, please consider contributing to this repository.
