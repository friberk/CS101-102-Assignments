2. **Convert Numbers**  
    Design and implement a GUI application that converts decimal, hex and binary numbers, as shown in the figure below. When you enter a decimal value in the decimal-value text field and press the Enter key, its corresponding hex and binary numbers are displayed in the other two text fields. Similarly, you can enter values in the other fields and convert them accordingly. You should implement your own methods to do conversions.
