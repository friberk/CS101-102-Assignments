### **Homework Description:**  

This folder contains all the classes for the card game we designed in lectures.

If you are using VS Code, simply open the folder cardgame_homework provided to you on Moodle, and complete the implementation of all classes according to the comments following the design done in lectures.

If you are using a different IDE, simply copy all .java files as necessary
(note the src folder contains only the java source files, the classes folder contains only the .class files).

You can find the lecture slides with the design online at http://www.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/~adayanik/cs102/slides/CS102-set3.pdf

Your task is to complete the game. First make sure the project compiles and the CardGameTest class runs (ignore MyCardGame until everything else is working).

Take a look at each of the Java classes, see how they correspond to the design. You will see many methods are left for you "ToDo" -- that's your homework!

This is a graded homework and must be done in groups (minimum 2, maximum 3 students). Write the group members' full names and student ids in a file called ReadMe.txt in the src folder. In every .java file, you should list the names of the students who worked in that class implementation.

Only one of you should upload your solution to the moodle homework activity for HW2 by the specified due date with the filename, "HW2.zip".
