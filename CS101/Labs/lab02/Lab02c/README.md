**(c)** Create a new project Lab02c and write a program that reads two int values from the user, computes their sum, difference, product, the result of dividing them, and the remainder after such division, then prints out the resulting values. Experiment a bit. Try changing the value of a constant. Try putting an int value into a double variable and vice versa. What happens if one or both of the values are zero or negative? What happens if the values are very large, close to their maximum possible values? What happens if you change the types of all the variables to double? Try computing the maximum and minimum of the two values using the Math.max & Math.min functions.
