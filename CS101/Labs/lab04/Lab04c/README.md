### (c) Processing data... again?

Create another project, Lab04c, and write a program that finds the average, minimum and maximum, of a set of integer values up to, but not including the first negative value. Assume such a value always exists. _Hint:_ the negative value acts as a _sentinel_, standing guard at the end of the data to be processed! Demonstrate your program by having it process the same ``testdata.txt`` file as in part b.
