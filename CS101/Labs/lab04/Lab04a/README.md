### (a) Starting simple...

Create a new project, Lab04a, and inside the main method, first read a positive integer value,  **_n_**, from the user (if the value is not positive, simply print an error message & stop), then using that value, do each of the following tasks:

1.  Write a ***while*** loop to output the integer values from 0 up to **_n_** exclusive. Have the output appear on a single line with values separated by a space.
2.  Write a ***while*** loop to output the integer values from 0 up to **_n_** exclusive. The output should have five values per line, with values separated by a space.
3.  Write a ***while*** loop to output the integer values from **_n_** down to 0 inclusive. Have the output appear on a single line with values separated by a space.
4.  Write a ***while*** loop to output the _even_ values from \-**_n_** up to **_n_** inclusive. Have your output appear on a single line with values separated by a space.
5.  Write a ***while*** loop that outputs (separated by spaces, five numbers per line ) the squares of the _even_ values from 0 up to **_n_** inclusive.
6.  Write a ***while*** loop that outputs (separated by spaces, five numbers per line) the values which are divisible by 3 or 4, but not both, from **_n_** down to 3 inclusive.  For example, if **_n_** is 12, it should display 9 8 6 4 3.
7.  Write a ***while*** loop that outputs all of the divisors of **_n_**. For example, if **_n_** is 12, it must display 2 3 4 6 12.
8.  Write a ***while*** loop that, for every integer **_k_** from **_n_** down to 1, outputs the values of 1 / **_k_**  that are greater than 0.01. For example, if **_n_** is 5, it should output 0.20 0.25 0.33 0.50 1.00. Can you have the output appear with only two significant digits?
