### HW-01 ~ Supermarket Checkout

Design an algorithm to solve the final step in our supermarket shopping example, i.e. "Go to checkout and pay for items in trolley". Adopt a low-tech solution, using a calculator and a price list that gives the cost for each item in the market. Try to have several "levels", each of which has less than 7 +/- 2 pieces.
